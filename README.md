## She is my Universe

The worlds first VR flea sim!

This is my entry for [#js13k2017](http://js13kgames.com/)

The theme was 'lost'

## Instructions

Hey little flea, you've lost your hairy tasty host.

Where could she be?

Hop to it and find her.

```
Big yellow cursor = look to hop

Small red cursor = suck blood

Orange cursor = does nothing

Look at stuff to interact (setup for Google Cardboard).
```

## Details

Total compressed game size is approx 12kb. Could've made it even smaller.

Has not been tested using any VR headsets.

Works on desktop in Chrome, although it is a bit glitchy.

Occasionally requires several attempts to get a bite.

Made using [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)

Uses modified version of these components:

[custom text component](https://github.com/BoldBigflank/js13k-polyhedron/blob/master/src/html/index.html#L95-L136)

[crawling cursor](https://github.com/jujunjun110/aframe-crawling-cursor)

[constant spawner](https://github.com/Anjlo/AFrame-Additions/tree/master/Spawner)
